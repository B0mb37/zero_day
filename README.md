# ALX ZERO DAY
I did this before.


## Did I?
Yes, I had good info on here but somehow since I did not open vim with sudo, I could not save it.


### Am I in trouble?
Probably. I cannot give my user account su status. I have tried but it seems this computer is too dumb. And as I keep doing stuff I fear I might have to reinstall this OS after messing stuff up. For a third time! 
Why can't it read my mind though? I feel like a woman right now. AI needs to pull its socks up and mae it to all programs. A simple answer on ChatGPT is always nice but feels limited. I don't know what I will do.
