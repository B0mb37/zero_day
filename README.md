#ALX ZERO DAY
I did this before.


##Did I?
Yes, I had good info on here but somehow since I did not open vim with sudo, I could not save it.


###Am I in trouble?
Probably. I cannot give my user accoubt su status. I have tried but it sems this computer is too dumb. Why can't it read my mind? I feel lie a woman right now.
